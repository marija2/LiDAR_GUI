# LiDAR_GUI
GUI for retrieving and viewing LiDAR data

Note: The front-end design is currently not connected to the back-end. As part of my project, I only worked on the front-end.

This Graphical User Interface is designed in order to provide a simple and easy way for retrieving and viewing LiDAR data.

The interface includes a tutorial which highlights the steps that can be taken in order to utilize the whole application.

If you are interested in the motivation behind this project, why LiDAR data is important and has many applications, or
simply want to read more about the interface, please refer to the Google Drive link below, where the project is laid out in detail.
