This project was done as part of the NYU Tandon Undergraduate Summer Research Program.
As part of my project, I only worked on the **front end**.

This Graphical User Interface is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly way of retrieving and viewing LiDAR data.
The interface includes a tutorial which highlights the steps that can be taken in order to utilize the whole application.
The user can select an area on the map and download data for the selected region.
