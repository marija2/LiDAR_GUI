# LiDAR_GUI
GUI for retrieving and viewing LiDAR data

Note: The front-end design is currently not connected to the back-end. As part of my project, I only worked on the front-end.

This Graphical User Interface is designed in order to provide a simple and easy way for retrieving and viewing LiDAR data.

The interface includes a tutorial which highlights the steps that can be taken in order to utilize the whole application.
