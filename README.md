# LiDAR_GUI
GUI for retrieving and viewing LiDAR data

Note: The front-end design is currently not connected to the back-end. As part of my project, I worked on the front end.

Files index.html and style.css were written by me.

This project was done as part of the NYU Tandon Undergraduate Summer Research Program.
